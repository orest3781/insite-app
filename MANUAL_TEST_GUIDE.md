4. Observe:
   - [ ] Processed items remain with COMPLETED status
   - [ ] Failed items remain with FAILED status
   - [ ] Unprocessed items remain with PENDING status
   - [ ] Queue is NOT cleared

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Queue state preserved correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Start button doesn't work
- [ ] Check if queue has items
- [ ] Check if orchestrator is initialized
- [ ] Look for warnings in logs

### Issue: Pause button doesn't work
- [ ] Check if processing is actually running (status should be green)
- [ ] Button should only be enabled during RUNNING state
- [ ] Check logs for pause_processing signal

### Issue: Stop button doesn't work
- [ ] Check if processing is running or paused
- [ ] Button should be disabled during IDLE/STOPPED states
- [ ] Check logs for stop_processing signal

### Issue: Counters not resetting
- [ ] Check if stop completes successfully
- [ ] Verify _handle_stop() is being called
- [ ] Check logs for reset messages

### Issue: Rapid clicks cause issues
- [ ] Look for queued signals in logs
- [ ] Check if state validation is working
- [ ] Verify orchestrator doesn't crash
