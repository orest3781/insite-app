# AI Model Manager Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the AI Model Manager dialog with 8 major improvements for better usability and functionality.

---

## üéØ Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Model Name Matching (CRITICAL BUG FIX)**
**Problem:** Dialog showed "llama3.2 NOT found" even when "llama3.2:latest" existed in the system.

**Solution:**
- Added `_models_match()` method that intelligently compares model names
- Strips `:latest` and other tags for comparison
- Now correctly recognizes "llama3.2" matches "llama3.2:latest"

**Code:**
```python
def _models_match(self, model1: str, model2: str) -> bool:
    """Check if two model names match (handles :latest tag)."""
    name1 = model1.split(':')[0]
    name2 = model2.split(':')[0]
    return name1 == name2
```

---

### 2. **Actual Model Pulling with Progress**
**Problem:** "Pull Model" button only showed terminal instructions instead of actually downloading.

**Solution:**
- Created `ModelPullThread` class for non-blocking downloads
- Integrated subprocess to run `ollama pull` directly
- Real-time progress updates in diagnostics
- Progress bar shows download status
- Auto-refreshes model list after successful pull

**Features:**
- Shows indeterminate progress bar during download
- Streams output line-by-line to diagnostics
- Confirms action with user before downloading
- Disables controls during download
- Handles errors gracefully

---

### 3. **Model Selection & Default Setting**
**Problem:** No way to change which model is used as default.

**Solution:**
- Double-click any model to set as default
- "‚≠ê Set as Default" button for selected model
- Confirmation dialog before changing
- Visual indicator (‚≠ê) shows current default
- Updates adapter's model_name setting

**Usage:**
1. Select a model from the list
2. Click "‚≠ê Set as Default" or double-click
3. Confirm the change
4. Model immediately becomes active

---

### 4. **Model Deletion**
**Problem:** No way to remove unwanted models.

**Solution:**
- "üóëÔ∏è Delete Model" button
- Runs `ollama rm <model-name>` command
- Prevents deletion of default model (safety feature)
- Confirmation dialog before deleting
- Auto-refreshes list after deletion

**Safety Features:**
- Cannot delete the currently active default model
- Requires explicit confirmation
- Shows clear error messages if deletion fails

---

### 5. **Copy Command to Clipboard**
**Problem:** Had to manually type terminal commands.

**Solution:**
- "üìã Copy Command" button
- Copies `ollama pull <model>` to clipboard
- Works with entered model name or default model
- Shows confirmation in diagnostics
- Easy paste into terminal

---

### 6. **Better Visual Feedback**
**Problem:** Hard to identify which model was active.

**Solution:**
- Default model marked with ‚≠ê emoji
- Green background highlight for default model
- Label shows "(default)" next to active model
- Clear checkmarks (‚úì) for all available models

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
‚≠ê llama3.2:latest (default)  [Green background]
‚úì qwen2.5:14b
‚úì qwen2.5:32b
‚úì llava:7b
```

---

### 7. **Improved Status Messages**
**Problem:** Confusing or missing diagnostics.

**Solution:**
- Shows which model name matched (e.g., "llama3.2" available as "llama3.2:latest")
- Lists available models when default not found
- Better troubleshooting steps
- Real-time pull progress in diagnostics
- Clear success/failure messages

---

### 8. **Enhanced UI Controls**
**Problem:** Limited interaction options.

**Solution:**
- Buttons enable/disable based on context
- Double-click support for quick actions
- Progress bar for downloads
- Tooltips on all action buttons
- Better help text

**Smart Enabling:**
- "Set as Default" only enabled when model selected
- "Delete Model" only enabled when model selected
- "Pull Model" disabled during active download
- Input field disabled during download

---

## üîß Technical Details

### New Classes

#### ModelPullThread
Handles asynchronous model downloading without blocking UI.

**Signals:**
- `pull_started(str)` - Emitted when pull begins
- `pull_progress(str, str)` - Progress updates (model, text)
- `pull_completed(str, bool, str)` - Completion (model, success, message)

**Features:**
- Runs `ollama pull` via subprocess
- Streams output line-by-line
- Handles errors (missing ollama, network issues)
- Can be terminated if needed

---

### Modified Methods

#### `_on_status_checked()`
- Now stores available models in `_available_models`
- Uses `_find_matching_model()` for flexible matching
- Shows better diagnostics with model matching info

#### `_create_model_group()`
- Added "Set as Default" button
- Added "Delete Model" button
- Added "Copy Command" button
- Added pull progress bar
- Connected double-click handler
- Better tooltip and help text

---

### New Methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `_models_match()` | Compare model names ignoring tags |
| `_find_matching_model()` | Find model in list with flexible matching |
| `_on_model_selection_changed()` | Enable/disable buttons based on selection |
| `_on_model_double_clicked()` | Set default on double-click |
| `_set_default_model()` | Change default model |
| `_delete_model()` | Remove model from system |
| `_copy_pull_command()` | Copy command to clipboard |
| `_on_pull_progress()` | Handle pull progress updates |
| `_on_pull_completed()` | Handle pull completion |

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Model Matching Test**
   - Verify "llama3.2" correctly matches "llama3.2:latest"
   - Check green highlight on default model
   - Confirm ‚≠ê emoji appears

2. **Pull Model Test**
   - Enter a new model name (e.g., "llama3.2:3b")
   - Click "Pull Model"
   - Verify progress bar appears
   - Watch diagnostics for progress
   - Confirm model appears in list after completion

3. **Set Default Test**
   - Select a non-default model
   - Click "Set as Default"
   - Confirm dialog appears
   - Verify ‚≠ê moves to new model

4. **Delete Model Test**
   - Try to delete default model (should be blocked)
   - Select non-default model
   - Click "Delete Model"
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify model removed from list

5. **Copy Command Test**
   - Enter model name
   - Click "Copy Command"
   - Paste in terminal (should be valid command)

---

## üîç Known Limitations

1. **Config Persistence**
   - Changing default model updates `adapter.model_name` at runtime
   - Changes don't persist to config.json automatically
   - User must update config file or restart app

2. **Download Progress**
   - Progress bar is indeterminate (no percentage)
   - Ollama doesn't provide progress percentages easily
   - Text updates show status instead

3. **Error Handling**
   - Requires Ollama CLI to be in PATH
   - Network errors during pull may timeout
   - Large models may appear to hang (actually downloading)

---

## üí° Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Model Details Panel**
   - Show model size, parameters, modified date
   - Display model description from Ollama registry
   - Show VRAM requirements

2. **Model Categories**
   - Separate vision models (llava) from text models
   - Tag models by use case (coding, chat, vision)
   - Show recommended models

3. **Config Integration**
   - Save default model to config.json
   - Persist temperature, max_tokens changes
   - Multiple model profiles

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Show model inference speed
   - Display tokens/second
   - Memory usage per model

5. **Auto-Updates**
   - Check for model updates
   - Notify when newer versions available
   - One-click update models

---

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Added Imports
```python
import subprocess  # For running ollama commands
import re  # For regex parsing model names
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QMessageBox, QApplication  # For dialogs & clipboard
```

### Thread Safety
- All subprocess calls run in background threads
- UI updates via signals to main thread
- Prevents blocking during downloads

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing `ollama` command
- Network timeout protection
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic cleanup on failures

---

## üéâ Impact

These improvements transform the AI Model Manager from a **passive status viewer** into an **active management tool**. Users can now:

- ‚úÖ Diagnose issues more accurately
- ‚úÖ Download models without leaving the app
- ‚úÖ Switch between models easily
- ‚úÖ Clean up unused models
- ‚úÖ Get immediate feedback on all actions

**Result:** Significantly better user experience and reduced friction in AI model management.
