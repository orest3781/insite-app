## 💡 Key Insights

### Insight 1: The Config Bug
```
User sets model as default
Dialog says "✅ Changed!"
User closes app and reopens
"Wait... why is it still the old model?"
User thinks: "This feature is broken" 😞

FIX: Actually save to config file (15 min)
```

### Insight 2: Scale Problem
When users have 8+ models installed:
- Current: Scroll through entire list 
- Solution: Add search box
- Impact: 10x faster to find models

### Insight 3: Information Gap
Users don't know:
- How much space a model needs
- How long download will take
- If something is working

### Insight 4: Professional Polish
Good architecture + missing details = users think it's incomplete

### Insight 5: High ROI
3 hours of work → transforms user experience from 6/10 to 9/10
