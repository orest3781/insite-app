# Session Summary - Queue Indicator Enhancement

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Replace numeric badge with glowing green dot  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

## 🎯 Objective

**User Request:** "instead of a number can there be a glowing green dot on the queue tab if there are files ready"

**Goal:** Replace the numeric count badge `(5)` with a visually striking animated green dot `🟢`

---

## 📝 What Was Done

### 1. Animation System Added
- Created glow intensity tracking (`_glow_intensity`, `_glow_direction`)
- Added QTimer for 50ms updates (20 FPS)
- Implemented smooth pulsing algorithm (30-100% intensity)

### 2. Visual Indicator Updated
- Changed from `"📋 Queue (5)"` to `"📋 Queue 🟢"`
- Added green color styling to tab text
- Made text bold when indicator is active
- Applied breathing animation effect

### 3. State Management
- Timer starts when files added to queue
- Timer stops when queue empties
- Smooth transitions between states
- Proper cleanup on state changes

---

## 💻 Code Changes

### Files Modified: 1
- `src/ui/main_window.py` (+45 lines)

### New Code Sections

#### Instance Variables (in `__init__`)
```python
self._glow_intensity = 0
self._glow_direction = 1
self._glow_timer = QTimer()
self._glow_timer.timeout.connect(self._animate_queue_glow)
```

#### New Method
```python
def _animate_queue_glow(self):
    """Animate the glowing effect on the queue tab."""
    # Intensity oscillates between 30-100
    # Color transitions from rgb(0,80,0) to rgb(0,255,0)
    # Updates tab stylesheet every 50ms
```

#### Updated Method
```python
def _update_queue_badge(self):
    """Update queue tab with glowing green dot indicator."""
    # Checks queue count
    # Shows 🟢 if files present
    # Starts/stops animation timer
    # Resets styling when empty
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Animation Specs
- **Speed:** 50ms refresh (20 FPS)
- **Range:** 30% to 100% intensity
- **Color:** rgb(0, 80, 0) → rgb(0, 255, 0)
- **Pattern:** Smooth sawtooth wave (fade in/out)
- **Duration:** ~2 second full cycle

### Visual States
```
Empty:      📋 Queue          (normal text, no animation)
Has Files:  📋 Queue 🟢       (green, bold, pulsing)
```
